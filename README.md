## Travel Diary

I love working with data visualization libraries and am an avid follower of [DataIsBeautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/).
Personally, I think data visualization is extrememly fascinating because it allows us to look at data differently -- more imaginatively.
Prior to D3.js, I didn't know it was possible to make such fantastic interactive visualizations out of data (this [koala visualization](http://www.koalastothemax.com/) still blows my mind and [this one](http://www.brightpointinc.com/2015-nfl-predictions/) is super cool too).
After browsing through past creations people have made with D3.js, I decided to experiment with it.
